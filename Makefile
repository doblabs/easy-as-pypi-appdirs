# This is not so elegant, I admit, but it's the best I've got.
# - There's a conflict between Sphinx dependencies and flake8 and doc8
#   dependencies, so we use a pseudo subproject to install those lint
#   tools into their own virtual environment. So we have to change to
#   the pseudo subproject directory and run poetry from there, to access
#   those tools.
# - Note that `make` executes each line in its own subshell, hence the
#   multiple `@cd` commands.
#   - Note also that `cd` itself is a Bash command, so we cannot run
#     `poetry run cd .. && ...` but must instead invoke Bash (`bash -c`).
# - The `poetry run` command loads the venv before running the command
#   -- which, phew!, is a blessing, because we cannot call `poetry shell`
#   from this Makefile (the `shell` command runs a new interactive shell
#   and blocks until you `exit` from it, so you can cannot do, e.g.,
#   `poetry shell && echo HI` and except the echo to happen from within
#   the new shell, because the echo won't happen until you exit the shell).
# - Finally, unset the VIRTUAL_ENV variable so that `poetry run` doesn't
#   not run if called from within a virtual environment. (I didn't read
#   any documentation on if this is okay to do, and I didn't check source,
#   so this is my own unsanctioned hack, and it could easily break in a
#   future Poetry release. -(lb))

#   - To alter the generated HTML, add options to the `automodule` directives.
#   - The author was led to believe you could influence these options from
#     docs/conf.py, but I was not successful going that route.
#   - So instead, we can just inject changes after those files are created.
#   - If you want to change the generated HTML, and perhaps compare to the
#     default HTML to see what changes, you can tinker with docs-inject.
#     - Perhaps:
#         make docs-inject
#         mv docs/_build docs/_build-new
#         sensible-open docs/_build-new/html/index.html
#         make docs
#     - Currently, docs-inject only adds two options to the final package
#       `automodule`, but you could easily craft a `sed` or `awk` script
#       to achieve more advanced injection.
